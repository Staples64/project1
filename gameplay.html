        Splatoonâ€™s gameplay primarily revolves around 2 teams of four battling in Turf War or Ranked Battles by flinging ink from various weapons to assert their victory. In Turf Wars, teams have three minutes to cover as much of a stage in their teams ink color before time runs out. In Ranked, squads will fight for control of a moving tower,  a splatzone, throw clams, or carry a rainmaker to the goal inside the enemy teams base. </p>
